# Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language that is primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on the web. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript enables developers to enhance user experiences by allowing them to create responsive and interactive web applications.

## Key Features of JavaScript

- **Interactivity**: JavaScript allows you to create interactive elements on web pages, such as forms, games, and dynamic content updates.
- **Versatility**: It can be used for both client-side and server-side development.
- **Event-Driven**: JavaScript can respond to user actions, such as clicks, form submissions, and keyboard inputs.
- **Cross-Platform**: JavaScript runs on any device with a web browser, making it highly accessible.

## First Program in JavaScript

Let's write a simple JavaScript program that displays "Hello, World!" in the console.

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment in JavaScript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

To run this program, you can open your browser's developer console and paste the code above. You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed in the console.

Happy coding!
